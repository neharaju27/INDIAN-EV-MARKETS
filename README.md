## Design decisions or assumptions
- Used Alatair Charts instead of Streamlit Charts for sorting data and applying custom color schemes.
- Used Plotly Express library for line plots instead of Streamlit Line plots for further customisation options.
- Used Mapbox library for a responsive and better looking map plot.
- Used third party Geojson data for accurate map plotting.
- Webapp divided into different segments for different analysis.
- Specific filters are segregated according to each section of analysis.
- Used a custom footer component available in Streamlit community, due to no footer component in streamlit documentation.
